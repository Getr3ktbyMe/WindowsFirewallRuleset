Users attempt to connect to a Miracast receiver as they did previously.
When the list of Miracast receivers is populated, Windows 10 will identify that the receiver is capable of supporting a connection over the infrastructure.
When the user selects a Miracast receiver, Windows 10 will attempt to resolve the device's hostname via standard DNS, as well as via multicast DNS (mDNS).
If the name is not resolvable via either DNS method, Windows 10 will fall back to establishing the Miracast session using the standard Wi-Fi direct connection." @Logs | Format-Output @Logs
