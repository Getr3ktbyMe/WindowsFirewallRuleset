Troubleshooting discovery:
again Settings -> System -> System info -> Advanced system settings -> Computer name -> Network ID -> this is home computer
Function Discovery Resource Publication to delayed start (or just restart for quick effect)
disable IPv6 (may cause unresponsiveness if router does not support IPv6)
Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) -> WINS -> Enable LMHOSTS lookup
Remove/uninstall unneeded virtual adapters.

Make This PC Discoverable in PC settings: (probably step 3 does that implicitly)
---The Make this PC discoverable setting will not be available if you have UAC set to Always notify.
---Setting UAC to a different level will allow Make this PC discoverable settings to be available.
---The Make this PC discoverable setting will not be available if you have created a Hyper-V virtual switch
---with this Ethernet connection.

Troubleshoot name resolution (discovery)
powershell:
nbtstat -c
nbtstat -r
netview

more discovery tools:
restart on both PC's function discovery resource publication
restart on both PC's computer browser
