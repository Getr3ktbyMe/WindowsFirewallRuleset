# Windows firewall predefined (built in) rules

Default Windows firewall has bunch of predefined rules,
however this project will not make use of these rules,
because they don't comply with project policy which is that a rule must be
restrictive and contain a good comment.

For example most predefined rules don't specify remote port or address,
or are missing other information which
could be easily provided for custom built firewall, also comments are not very informative.
In other words predefined rules are neither restrictive nor informative.

Thus this project reinvents the wheel, and groups those predefined rules into custom groups.
Custom rule groups don't interfere with predefined groups to be able to distinguish project rules
from predefined rules.

Some of the rules retain grouping while other are grouped into existing groups, grouping exceptions
are listed below.
