.SYNOPSIS
Resolves an IP address expression using wildcard expressions to individual IP addresses.
.DESCRIPTION
Resolves an IP address expression using wildcard expressions to individual IP addresses.
Resolve-IPAddress expands groups and values in square brackets to generate a list of IP addresses or networks using CIDR-notation.
Ranges of values may be specified using a start and end value using "-" to separate the values.
Specific values may be listed as a comma separated list.
.PARAMETER IPAddress
The IPAddress expression to resolve.
.EXAMPLE
Resolve-IPAddress "10.[1,2].[0-2].0/24"

Returns the addresses 10.1.0.0/24, 10.1.1.0/24, 10.1.2.0/24, 10.2.0.0/24, and so on.
.INPUTS
System.String
.OUTPUTS
TODO: describe outputs
.NOTES
Following changes by metablaster:
- Include licenses and move comment based help outside of functions
- For code to be consistent with project: code formatting and symbol casing.
- Removed unnecessary position arguments, added default argument values explicitly.
